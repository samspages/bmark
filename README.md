WIP GLFW(and/or)OpenGl based CPU benchmarking tool 

Goals:
- Build a safe and functional benchmarking tool that can reliably perform stress tests on varying hardware
- Use an experimental approach to loading the CPU
- Learn about hardware specific operations
Options below are being considered for CPU heavy processes
    -> Based ray casting simulation
    -> Large scale cellular automata ie. Conways Game of Life
    -> Fluid Dynamics Simulation ie. Navier Stokes 
    -> Graph/Data Structure Visualizations ie. Very large/pathological N inputs to Sorting algorithms, Large graph net flow solver, Stack frame visualizer. 
    -> Cryptography
    -> Decompression/Compression

as part of the cpu load we will also be writing many useless for loops and random forks and mutex locks.
